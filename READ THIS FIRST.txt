Before running these php files, make sure you import freshmart.sql in your local db. 

To do that.. first make a database named 'freshmart' all lowercaps..  and then import the sql file. 

Trader interface is still incomplete in this version and i'll upload the complete version once we combine all work in progress into single easy to use-read-manage Repository. 

All tables are not present in this sql file.
